    "The rationale for this mapping is the following:\n",
    "1. `ci_id`, `run_id` and `squash_id` are sequential ids. `ci_url` and `run_id_url` are different for each run. The reason for adding them as InfluxDB fields is to [reduce InfluxDB series cardinality](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/schema_and_data_layout/#discouraged-schema-design) (DM-18342) and we also want to display these information in the dashboards.\n",
    "2. We define a common datamodel mapping variables from different execution environments example `ci_id` and `run_id` to `run_id`, `ci_url` and `run_id_url` to `run_url`, `ci_dataset` and `dataset` to `dataset`. The corresponding values can be filtered by the `env_name` tag. \n",
    "3. It is not possible to do [math operations with InfluxDB timestamps](https://community.influxdata.com/t/math-operations-on-field-value-and-time/6323/4) so it is useful to add the `timestamp` explicitly as a field. There's also a `date` field which is added as environment metadata that we don't need in InfluxDB (DM-17049)\n",
    "4. `lsst.verify` metadata uses `filter_name`. We decided to rename it since it is commonly called filter in the dataID used in processing with DM software.\n",
    "5. `ci_label` does not seem important so we skip that.\n",
    "6. `ci_name` is mapped to `pipeline` to identify which pipeline ran that. That's important because some pipeline can have several verication packages which will be mapped to different InfluxDB measurements so we might want to group them.\n",
    "7. We add the code changes information for pipelines that run in the Jenkins environment.\n",
    "8. We also skip `packages` metadata for now. \n",
    "9. Other metadata not listed in the mapping are automatically added as InfluxDB tags.\n",
